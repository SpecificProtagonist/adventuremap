Elysium, the holy city. Not that there ever had been anything holy about it but people liked to pretend. After all, it was the largest city they knew of and every self-respecting man added a new hall or spire. And so, without plan, hills grew, hills of stone, buildings constructed on top of each other, the deeper layers quickly forgotten. No one paid any attention to the infection that was spreading beneath.



And so the last of the rott was cut away. The city was freed from its infection. Above, her citizens continued to trade, build and squabble, unaware of the danger that had loomed over them. To them, nothing had changed.
